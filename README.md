# How to Select the Ideal Indian Proxy for Your Requirements?
When deciding between free and paid proxies, several factors come into play. Casual users might find free proxies adequate for basic browsing needs, while businesses or individuals dealing with sensitive data might prefer the increased security provided by paid proxies. Budget considerations also play a part, as users balance the costs with the benefits of the chosen proxy solution.

There's an array of proxy services available, but their reliability varies. We've done some research to help you identify the best proxies for accessing Indian websites from overseas. Here are some key factors to consider:

Fast Video Streaming: Ensure the proxy server you select provides quick and steady connections for uninterrupted video enjoyment.

Ease of Use: A proxy service with a user-friendly interface simplifies the management of proxy settings.

Compatibility with Popular Operating Systems: Confirm that the proxy service supports the operating system you use, such as Windows, MAC OS, or Linux.

# India Proxy Recommendation
The following list of top Indian proxy servers includes those offering both residential and datacenter proxies. While each type has its own benefits, we strongly suggest using a residential proxy. Residential proxies are IP addresses assigned to home-based devices, sourced from genuine residential ISPs. These are tied to actual residential addresses, offering a higher degree of authenticity and credibility. However, residential proxies are typically more costly than other proxy types.

OkeyProxy boasts a network of over 150 million residential IPs, including more than 8 million IPs from India. Beyond India, OkeyProxy provides coverage for over 200+ countries globally. OkeyProxy is more cost-effective, with prices starting as low as $6 for 2GB. Furthermore, it offers a 1GB free trial.https://www.okeyproxy.com/proxy
